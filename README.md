# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where parsing the JSON request body fails when the request body is empty or contains invalid JSON.  The `express.json()` middleware is used, but it doesn't handle these edge cases gracefully, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

## Bug Report

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js application that attempts to parse JSON data from POST requests to the `/data` endpoint.  If the request body is empty or contains invalid JSON, the application will throw an error, which you can verify by making a request using tools like Postman or curl.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to address the issue by implementing error handling.  The solution uses a `try...catch` block around the `JSON.parse()` method to handle potential errors when parsing the request body. This prevents application crashes and provides more robust error handling.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
4. Run `node bug.js` to start the buggy application.
5. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/data` with an empty body or invalid JSON.
6. Observe the error.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 with `bugSolution.js` to see the improved error handling.
